Follow Focus Gear - Hasselblad CF 50mm Distagon Lens
=============

A simple friction mount follow focus gear designed to fit the barrel of the Hasselblad CF 50mm Distagon prime lens. Gear pitch is the standard 0.8mm.

Designed with [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/).

Instructions
--------
I printed with HIPS filament on the following settings, and results were great

* Layer height: 0.22
* Walls: 1.05
* Fill: 20

I suppose if you're concerned about the aesthetics you could use 0.1 layers but to my eye it really wasn't enough a difference to justify the print time.
